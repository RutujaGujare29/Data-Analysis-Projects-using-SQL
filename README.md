# Data-Analysis-Projects-using-SQL


The projects in this directory showcase my proficiency in SQL, emphasizing the essential skills and techniques that data analysts use to explore, clean, and analyze data while effectively communicating insights to non-technical audiences. Each project involves setting up and managing databases, conducting thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), and crafting advanced SQL queries to answer complex business questions.

Through these hands-on projects, I have honed my ability to derive actionable insights from raw data, make data-driven decisions, and present findings in a clear, concise manner. These experiences have not only solidified my foundation in SQL but also enhanced my capability to tackle real-world data challenges, making these projects an ideal reflection of my analytical expertise.
