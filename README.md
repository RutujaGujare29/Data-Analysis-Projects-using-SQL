# Data-Analysis-Projects-using-SQL


Projects in this directory are designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, analyze data and communicate findings to non technical audience. These projects involve setting up a database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), using advanced SQL queries to answer specific business questions. These projects are ideal for data analysis and have helped me build a solid foundation in SQL.
